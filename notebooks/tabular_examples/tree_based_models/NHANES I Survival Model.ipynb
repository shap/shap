It is designed to illustrate how SHAP values enable the interpretion of XGBoost models with a clarity traditionally only provided by linear models. We see interesting and non-linear patterns in the data, which suggest the potential of this approach. Keep in mind the data has not yet been checked by us for calibrations to current lab tests and so you should not consider the results as actionable medical insights, but rather a proof of concept. \n",

    "See the Tree SHAP paper for more details, but briefly, SHAP interaction values are a generalization of SHAP values to higher order interactions. Fast exact computation of pairwise interactions are implemented in the latest version of XGBoost with the pred_interactions flag. With this flag XGBoost returns a matrix for every prediction, where the main effects are on the diagonal and the interaction effects are off-diagonal. The main effects are similar to the SHAP values you would get for a linear model, and the interaction effects captures all the higher-order interactions are divide them up among the pairwise interaction terms. Note that the sum of the entire interaction matrix is the difference between the model's current output and expected output, and so the interaction effects on the off-diagonal are split in half (since there are two of each). When plotting interaction effects the SHAP package automatically multiplies the off-diagonal values by two to get the full interaction effect."
